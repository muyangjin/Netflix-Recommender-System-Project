# Netflix Recommender System Project

The purpose of this project is to propose sev-
eral viable models by introducing concepts, an-
alyzing advantages and disadvantages, evaluat-
ing performance, and understanding the rec-
ommendation dynamics.

The project is the final project for NYU DS-GA 1001 Intro to Data Science

## Data 
Data comes from kaggle [MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prajitdatta/movielens-100k-dataset). 
Also uploaded, simply download everything and run the Jupyter Notebooks. 

## Code
Packeges used: pandas, numpy, surprise, scikit-learn, etc.

***data-preprocessing***: some data cleaning and data visualization. 

***baseling-model***: implemented several baseline models: only mean of the ratings, weighed mean, SVM, gradient boosting, etc.

***surprise***: implemented several recommender system models from packege surprise: SVD, SCD++, NMF, kNN, and performed stacking.

***evaluation***: tested model accuracy, coverage, diversity through several metrics.
